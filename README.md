# CriminalIntent

## Description:
CriminalIntent records the details of “office crimes” – things like leaving dirty dishes in the break room sink or walking away from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.

With CriminalIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook, or another app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.

> The application is built by following chapters of [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/android-programming-the/9780135257555/).

## Chapters:

## Challenges:

- [x] RecyclerView ViewTypes (page 193)

- [x] Formatting the Date (page 220)

- [x] More Dialogs (page 274)

- [x] Empty View (page 290)

- [ ] Multiple Main Activities (this isn't from the book, this is one I made up) The book mentioned that on a tablet, you could have both the list view and the detailed view fragments running at the same time. The challenge is to do that!

~~- [ ] Name Your Challenge: If you have a great idea for adding to the app, run the idea by me. If it sounds good, implementing the idea would count as a challenge!~~

- [x] Implement delete crime feature in CrimeFragment with delete menu button on appBar and ConfirmDialog.
